Repository for S Elective Seminar: Public Preferences and Social Policy: The Impacts of Immigration in Europe. [S] [1. PG] (FSS 2018)

## DESCRIPTION:
The number of foreign-born persons in Western Europe increased dramatically over the past three decades. Also in Eastern European countries, immigrants are increasing in numbers for the first time since transition. This produces many social outcomes that link to trust, voting, inequality and the role of the state. For example, having more foreigners in a country or region may reduce trust and increase intergroup conflicts. In Germany, for the first time since WWII, an anti-immigrant, populist party gained substantial political power. Also, many immigrants, in particular refugees or family reunification immigrants, face substantial labor market disadvantage and poverty. Many states were not equipped to deal with immigration and refugee asylum seeking on the scale that developed in recent history. All of these features of European societies affect public preferences and public opinion. At the same time, public preferences and opinion shapes how governments react to immigration.

This course considers the many linkages between public preferences and social policies as they relate to immigrants, immigration and refugee seeking in Europe. It considers how the public reacts to immigration in voting, group dynamics and social movements (protests, violence). It considers how immigrants react to their statuses in European countries. It looks at how public reactions link to state policies and the distribution of power among political parties, and how states interact with each other in the European Union. All of this will take place with a focus on survey data using the [European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) (ESS). We will read relevant literature and analyze relevant data as part of the course work. This data analysis will take place using Stata statistical software. Knowledge of Stata is not necessary, but will be helpful for students in this course.

A primary project during the course is to replicate the work of Sides and Citrin (2007) and Emmenegger and Klemmensen (2013) using the ESS.

## WORKING WITH THE ESS
The users will need to download the file [ESS1-7e01.dta](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/downloadwizard/) with all countries and variables selected to follow the course structure. The file is then cleaned using the Cleaning Appendix [cleaness.do](nbreznau/ESS-PPSP-course/edit/master/cleaness.do) mostly to reduce its size.
